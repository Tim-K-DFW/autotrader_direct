The app is deployed at https://murmuring-wave-4290.herokuapp.com/.

It works on simple one-word makes and models (e.g. "Honda Civic") but trips on series (e.g. "Mercedes CLS Class"). I will finally fix it (add drop-down selects for Make and Model which should eliminate the bug) sometime in February or March.

Currently I'm focused entirely on the Rails course...
